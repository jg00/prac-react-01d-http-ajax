## React App - HTTP Requests (in progress)

Created a simple React app to reach out to the web via Axios package.
Used JSONPlaceholder free online REST API to work with fake data.

## Below are a few basic features applied to this app.

- The app initially pulls all posts from the API and displays only four for demo.
- New post request can be sent to the JSONPlaceholder API (Only produces a response for demo).
- Delete post request can be sent to the JSONPlaceholder API (Only produces a response for demo).
